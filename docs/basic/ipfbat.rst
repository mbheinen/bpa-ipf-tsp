``ipfbat`` is a command line program that is the batch version of ``ipfsrv``. It accepts a Powerflow Control Language (.pcl) file. Plotting can be done with a control file; however, for most plots ``ipfplot`` is easier to use. Example of use: ``ipfbat bench.pcl``. The PCL commands used with ``ipfsrv`` and ``ipfbat`` are described in :ref:`powerflow-command-language`.
