``ipfplot``
***********
``ipfplot`` is a batch plotting program to produce printed maps. The program accepts a coordinate file (``.cor``) and a base case file (``.bse``) on the command line, as well as an optional second base case file. When the second base case file is specified, a difference plot is produced. You can also use IPFPLOT to produce bubble diagrams. The same coordinate files are used for both GUI and IPFPLOT, but not all capabilities are available in the GUI.
