PFC Examples

This section gives several examples of PFC files that can be used with the ``bpf`` process.

Base Case Example
=================
Here is a basic powerflow run that contains all data in the control file (``ninebus.pfc``).

A more convenient method to perform the preceding setup is to use a ``NETWORK_DATA`` command and provide the network data portion (the power system network) in a separate file and similarly a ``INCLUDE_CONTROL`` command and provide the control comands in a separate file as well. The PFC file would look like this::

  (  POWERFLOW,CASEID=NINEBUS,  PROJECT = EXAMPLES  ) 
  / HEADER 
  H      WSCC Nine Bus Base Case 
  / COMMENT 
  C 
  C  CASEB-1_  NINE-BUS CASE, ON CARDS, THAT IN ADDITION TO TESTING 
  C            THE FEATURES OF CASE A-1, ALSO FEATURES TRANSFORMERS 
  C            AND SUBTYPE "E" BUSES. 
  C 
  / NEW_BASE, FILE= ninebus.bse 
  / INCLUDE_CONTROL,FILE = ninebus.ctl 
  / NETWORK_DATA, FILE = ninebus.net 
  (STOP)

Where ``ninebus.ctl`` contains::

  / P_INPUT_LIST,FULL 
  / P_OUTPUT_LIST,FULL 
  / AI_LIST=NONE 
  / P_ANALYSIS_RPT,LEVEL = 4 
  / F_ANALYSIS_RPT,LEVEL = 1

and ``ninebus.net`` contains::

Change Case Example
===================
Here is an example of loading a system from a solved old base case, and make data changes, and save a new base.::

  ( POWERFLOW, CASEID = TEST-CHG,  PROJECT = TEST-WSCC-DATA) 
  / NEW_BASE, FILE = 9BUSNEW.BSE 
  / COMMENTS 
  C  CASEB-1_  NINE-BUS CASE, ON CARDS, THAT IN ADDITION TO TESTING THE 
  C             FEATURES OF CASE A-1, ALSO FEATURES  TRANSFORMERS AND 
  C             SUBTYPE "E" BUSES. 
  C                THE BUS_BRANCH FILE AND THE CHANGE FILE ARE REMOTE 
  / INCLUDE_CONTROLS, FILE = TESTCONT.CTL 
  / OLD_BASE, FILE= ninebus.bse 
  / CHANGES, FILE = CHANG.DAT 
  ( STOP - END OF TEST )

.. note::

  PFC language commands are not performed in the order they are encountered in the file, but rather in the order the ``bpf`` program decides is logical.

Merge Case Example 1
====================
Here is an example of merging two systems defined from sepearate solved old base files.::

  ( POWERFLOW, CASEID = TEST-MERGE, PROJECT = TEST-MERGE_OLD_BASE ) 
  /COMMENTS 
  C  CASE 2 - TEST BASE MERGE BY MERGING TWO IDENTICAL BASE SYSTEMS. 
  C           TWO MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE SUBSYSTEMS ARE INTEGRATED TO 
  C           REGENERATE THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM. 
  C 
  C    EACH SYSTEM IS BUILT FROM DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE SAME OLDBASE

  . 
  .      SUBSYSTEMS ARE NOW MERGED 
  . 
  .      ( CHANGES ) may now follow 
  . 
  ( STOP )

Merge Case Example 2
====================
Here is an example of merging two topologically overlapping networks into one consolidated network and solvubg the network, creating a new base to be called ``J86JFY82``. Each of the original networks is to be appropriately modified before the merger. The first network is a WSCC base case saved as ``86J201.BSE`` which must be modified by saving areas, excluding buses, renaming buses and excluding certain branches. The second network is the BPA system which will be extracted from the branch file ``BDFY82W`` using the extraction date Jan 1986.::

  (POWERFLOW, CASEID = J86FY82, PROJECT = BASEMERGE) 
  /NEWBASE FILE = [APF]J86FY82.BSE 
  . 
  .Note:  composite network will be solved with defaults.

  (STOP)

.. _reduction-case-exmaple:

Reduction Case Example
======================
Here is an example of reducing an existing network to a desired size and solving the reduced network. Reduction is achieved by retaining only specified zones from the original system. Produce full input/output listings on microfiche. Partial input/output listings (restricted to certain specified zones) will be printed on paper. Give full analysis report on both paper and fiche. In solving the network, regulating transformers will be activated and area-interchange control will be switched to control mode. Provide full listing of area interchange flows.::
