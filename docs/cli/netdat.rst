``netdat``
==========

``netdat`` is a command line program that converts a binary base file (``.bse``) created by ``bpf`` to 
an ASCII network data file. It provides similar function to ``ipfnet``, but  ``ipfnet`` generates a 
network data file based on the currently loaded case in the GUI, rather than from a ``.bse`` file.
